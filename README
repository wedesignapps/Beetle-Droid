Beetle Droid:

It is a podcast reader / player for Android platfrom that can download and synchronize any public audio content from online feeds, Google Reader, mRSS, and other podcast sources. Very similar to Google Listen. But we hope to improve the user interface and give ready made choices for users to immediately subscribe and start listening right away. Key development is tag based taxonomy that will help user to better organize their podcast subscriptions.
